# Hamlet
Secure webmail client for EasyCrypt email privacy service

Hamlet is a secure webmail client for desktop browsers that supports use of EasyCrypt email privacy service. It fully supports EasyCrypt’s Zero Knowledge operation for email content – no unencrypted content (email body and attachments) or private keys ever leave the user’s computer. It is fully compliant with OpenPGP and PGP/MIME. Future versions are planned to support anonymity and metadata protection as described on EasyCrypt.co website.
Hamlet is based on and incorporates code from RoundCube and uses EasyCrypt Service Plugin and EasyCrypt Adaptation Plugin for RoundCube. All the repos on which Hamlet depends are cloned here to support building Hamlet from this repo alone. 

Supported browsers (tested): Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Tor Browser Bundle on desktop PCs. Other desktop browsers are probably supported but were not tested yet. Chrome on Android tablets works fine, except some minor visual issues in portrait orientation which will be fixed later.
